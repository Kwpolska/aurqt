.. index:: contributing

Do you want to contribute to this project?  Great!  I’d love to see some help,
but you must comply with some rules.

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,
“SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”,  “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Issue reporting
---------------

.. index:: issues

GitHub Issues are the recommended way to report an issue.  If you do not have an
account there, get one or mail me.

When pasting console sessions, you must paste them fully, *prompt-to-prompt*,
to see all the messages and your input.  Trim only stuff that you are 1000%
sure that is not related to the project in question.

--------------------------------------------
General preparations, rules and pull process
--------------------------------------------

Prepare
=======

For code, a GitHub account is recommended.  For translations, a Transifex_
account is mandatory.  Code patches by mail are accepted, but working with you
through there is a better way.

Fork the repo first.  Non-GitHub people, ``git clone``.

.. _Rules:

Rules
=====

1. Commits must have short, informative and logical messages.  Signoffs and
   long messages are recommended.  “fixes #xxx” is required if an issue
   exists.
2. The following fancy Unicode characters should be used when
   needed: ``— “ ” ‘ ’``
3. The ellipsis (``…``) character must not be used in program output for
   humans, but may be used elsewhere.
4. I’m a Grammar Nazi.

Request a Pull
==============

Done?  Go hit the **Pull Request** button over on GitHub!  And if you don’t
use GitHub, ``git format-patch``.  Other formats are not accepted.

Your commit should be pulled up in a (longer) while.  If I like it.  Because
some commits may be bad.  So, do your best not to do those bad commits.

---------------------------------------
Details for specific contribution types
---------------------------------------

Code (Python)
=============

1. PEP 8.  ``pip install pep8`` is recommended.
2. ``./tests.py``.
3. Localize all the strings (``_('string')``)
4. Strings must be quoted using ``'str'``.  Multi-line strings, ``"""str"""``.
   Use the latter only if needed.  Otherwise, do:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   string = ('A very, very, very long string '
             'that’s broken up into multiple lines.')

   string = _('A very, very, very log string '
              'that’s broken up into multiple lines '
              'and that is localized through gettext.'))

5. ``str.format``.  Braces should be empty or contain a name that is later
   passed on to the function.  The format function should be inserted *after*
   the parenthesis for string localization.  For example:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   string = _('{} is awesome').format('PKGBUILDer')
   string = _('{sth} is awesome').format(sth='PKGBUILDer')

6. Documentation is important.  Please take care of it.

Code (non-Python)
=================

Rejected.

Non-code contributions
======================

Those are accepted.  No specific rules exist.  And don’t remove any files
without my permission (``docs/*.8.gz`` in particular).

Localization
============

.. index:: locale

As of version 0.1.2, translations are handled over at Transifex_.

.. _Transifex: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/pkgbuilder/
