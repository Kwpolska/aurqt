SYNOPSIS
========

*aurqt*

DESCRIPTION
===========

aurqt is an AUR *manager*.  Unlike its older brother, PKGBUILDer, it is a
graphical (Qt) tool, used to work with AUR, used in place of the AUR web
interface (aurweb).

COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS
======================

None, and there is no reason to have those.

USAGE
=====

The Online Manual will (work in progress!) contain more information about using
aurqt.  You can find it here: <http://pkgbuilder.rtfd.org>.

People with ability to use Linux shouldn’t have any problems with using aurqt,
as it is straightforward and user-friendly.
