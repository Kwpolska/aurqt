=============
aurqt is dead
=============

aurqt, the graphical AUR manager, has been abandoned and is not available
anymore due to multiple changes in the AUR itself and the status of the code
base that would require a full rewrite.  I apologize for the inconvenience.

(If anyone wants to take over development, please contact me.)
