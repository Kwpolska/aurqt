======================
aurqt progress reports
======================

Day 0, Day 0.5
==============

2012-10-04
----------

I published everything I have on aurqt.  That is, the UI designs from Qt
Creator and a README, with information about the project.

2012-10-05
----------

On day 0.5, I did nothing official, just some re-thinking and modifications in
the UI files.  I had a talk with a TU about the current situation with aurweb
and stuff.

Also, I put a note saying that pyuic4 may be worth a look.

Day 1
=====

2012-10-06
----------

It wasn’t.  The code generated by it is a total mess.  It’s a *generator*,
after all.

I read the awesome ZetCode tutorial, and I wrote the equivalent of main.ui and
about.ui.  It works!  Now, time to work on the other files.

Note: newupd.ui is supposed to display in the main.ui window at start.  It is
supposed to display (surprise, surprise!) packages that can be upgraded.  If
none, no window for you.  And if I can find a better way, that would be
awesome.

So, we’ll be doing them soon.  I hope.  Because I have no working libraries,
although those are not important now, and I have to work out how MDI windows
work.  Or, if you want it that way, google, read, and then do some
Ctrl+C-Alt+Tab-F10-i-Ctrl+Shift+V.  (F10 is mapped to paste mode in my .vimrc)

Day 2
=====

2012-10-07
----------

Today, I made the login form.  Login/logout are in AQDS, because they can.

Now, onto the harder part of this project: actually working on the MDI.  And I
have a source to copy-paste things from.  The PyQT examples.  The file
``/examples/mainwindows/mdi/mdi.py`` provides a very nice explanation and code
for what I need.

Also, I think I can destroy some of the progress bars I have scattered over the
UI files.

PS. Need a tagline ASAP.  Without it, I cannot do half of the stuff I want to.

Day 3
=====

2012-10-08
----------

Upgrade is 75% done.  I need to get threads done.

Days 4—7
========

2012-10-09—2012-10-12
---------------------

Didn’t have much time, did almost nothing…  Sorry.  In the middle of the week,
people LOVE to waste my time.

Day 8
=====

2012-10-13
----------

There we go!  85% done!  Now, on to doing the stuff that is not done yet.  In
particular:

 * info box completion (comments, data — the form layout crashed the app!)
 * preferences/config
 * package uploading
 * tagline (yes, could not think of one since 6 days)
 * testers

Day 9
=====

2012-10-14
----------

Further ahead.  Preferences, config, and account registration/modification are
done (although the account magic was not tested yet).  Also, minimizing of MDI
windows works properly now.

Stuff to do that I forgot about before or invented lately:

 * Window menu (copy over from PyQt examples)
 * logging
 * notifications about users’ packages (OutOfDate status change, new comments)

And probably more.

Day 10
======

2012-10-15
----------

Mostly testing and small fixes.  Also, a little fix to the design for Upload.

And tomorrow will be spent on doing the aforementioned Upload.

Bad news time: lxml is broken, and this bug completely breaks
``.aurweb.AurWeb().get_account_data``, i.e. data that contain spaces are not
returned fully and weird workarounds need to be used to make it work. (see
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+bug/1067004>; Launchpad sucks.)

Day 11
======

2012-10-16
----------

Upload’s UI is done, I just need to implement the AurWeb magic and the UI–AUR
link properly (so it doesn’t lag and the progress bar will update like in a
civilised app which I want aurqt to be but I seem to fail at.)

Day 12
======

2012-10-17
----------

Upload magic done, UI–magic link not yet (but (1/99999999999999999999999999)%
of code is already here)

Day 13
======

2012-10-18
----------

I love when shit breaks for me.  Today’s breakage is brought to you by
Requests.  https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/883 and we can’t
progress.  I did some magic in order to let myself work on Upload, but it
ain’t gonna be tested properly.  Why does it have to break so easily?
Currently, requests won’t work with both 3.1 and 3.3.  3.2 is working, but I
can’t downgrade.  And about running in a virtualenv, it might be hard to do.
So I can’t do anything about it but wait.  And wait.  And wait.

Day 14
======

2012-10-19
----------

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Development is temporarily paused until the problems are removed.  And the
whole thing started even before aurqt’s development.  I might produce some
code, but it will be untested.

Day 15
======

2012-10-20
----------

Logo done!

![aurqt logo](https://raw.github.com/Kwpolska/aurqt/master/logo.png)

In other news: info mostly done.  But it is broken because of the bug from day
10, I think.  Need to do the dates based on system (KDE) locale.  But that’s
not a thing I am doing today.

And upgrade is 100% done!  Yay~~

Day 16
======

2012-10-21
----------

Officially decided to ditch LXML and use something else.  So, Beautiful Soup 4
(python-beautifulsoup4) with the help of html.parser is the way to go.  And it
is done.  And much, MUCH more human-friendly in terms of code.

Info is even further.  Still need to do the dates and the topbar.  And
threading.

(Yesterdays’ changes didn’t get commited somehow.)

Day 17
======

2012-10-22
----------

Little fixes and PEP 8 compliance.

Day 18
======

2012-10-23
----------

System failure recovery (broken on day 17, right before pushing the changes.)
I needed just a ``mkinitcpio -p linux``, but (a) it is hard to get Windows to
put an ISO on a thumbdrive; and (b) I had no time thanks to third parties.

Day 19
======

2012-10-24
----------

Upload is more workable.  But I cannot test it, see day 13.  Info is also a bit
further.

Day 20
======

2012-10-25
----------

Testing day!  Also, small fixes to get stuff done better.  And flake8.

:ESTIMATED TIME OF COMPLETION: Tuesday 2012-11-06, after 32 days in
                               development.

Note that the d13 problems will make it unworkable by then, but I will
do all the final testing magic in a virtualenv.  Then, a closed beta,
and we release 0.1.0.

PS. in-program version number changed to 0.0.1.

Day 21
======

2012-10-26
----------

Notifications are written.  In other news: my ArchVM is up to the task of
testing stuff, because it hasn’t been updated since ages and I have py3.2
there!
