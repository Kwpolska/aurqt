======================
aurqt progress reports
======================

Day 0, Day 0.5
==============

2012-10-04
----------

I published everything I have on aurqt.  That is, the UI designs from Qt
Creator and a README, with information about the project.

2012-10-05
----------

On day 0.5, I did nothing official, just some re-thinking and modifications in
the UI files.  I had a talk with a TU about the current situation with aurweb
and stuff.

Also, I put a note saying that pyuic4 may be worth a look.

Day 1
=====

2012-10-06
----------

It wasn’t.  The code generated by it is a total mess.  It’s a *generator*,
after all.

I read the awesome ZetCode tutorial, and I wrote the equivalent of main.ui and
about.ui.  It works!  Now, time to work on the other files.

Note: newupd.ui is supposed to display in the main.ui window at start.  It is
supposed to display (surprise, surprise!) packages that can be upgraded.  If
none, no window for you.  And if I can find a better way, that would be
awesome.

So, we’ll be doing them soon.  I hope.  Because I have no working libraries,
although those are not important now, and I have to work out how MDI windows
work.  Or, if you want it that way, google, read, and then do some
Ctrl+C-Alt+Tab-F10-i-Ctrl+Shift+V.  (F10 is mapped to paste mode in my .vimrc)

Day 2
=====

2012-10-07
----------

Today, I made the login form.  Login/logout are in AQDS, because they can.

Now, onto the harder part of this project: actually working on the MDI.  And I
have a source to copy-paste things from.  The PyQT examples.  The file
``/examples/mainwindows/mdi/mdi.py`` provides a very nice explanation and code
for what I need.

Also, I think I can destroy some of the progress bars I have scattered over the
UI files.

PS. Need a tagline ASAP.  Without it, I cannot do half of the stuff I want to.

Day 3
=====

2012-10-08
----------

Upgrade is 75% done.  I need to get threads done.
